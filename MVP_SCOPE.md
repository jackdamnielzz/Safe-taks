# SafeWork Pro - MVP Scope Definition
## MoSCoW Feature Prioritization

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: September 29, 2025  
**Status**: Pending Market Validation  
**Review Cycle**: Update after customer interviews (Task 1.4A-1.4E)

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope for SafeWork Pro using MoSCoW methodology (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have). The scope is designed for a **solo developer delivering in 6-8 months** while maximizing value for B2B customers in the Dutch/European construction and industrial safety market.

**Key Principles:**
- **Market Validation First**: All "Must Have" features require customer validation before implementation
- **Launch Quality**: MVP must be production-ready, not prototype-quality
- **Deferred Complexity**: Advanced features moved to Phase 2 based on actual customer demand
- **Technical Excellence**: No technical debt shortcuts - build it right from the start

**MVP Launch Timeline**: Month 8 (after 2-3 weeks market validation pause)

---

## MoSCoW Categories Defined

### Must Have (MVP - Phase 1)
Features absolutely essential for launch. Without these, the product cannot function as a viable TRA/LMRA solution. These features must pass customer validation tests.

**Criteria:**
- Critical for core value proposition
- Required for legal/regulatory compliance (VCA)
- Validated as essential by target customers
- Technically feasible within 6-8 month timeline

### Should Have (Phase 2 - Post-Launch)
Important features that significantly enhance the product but can be added after launch based on customer feedback and usage patterns.

**Criteria:**
- Valuable but not launch-critical
- Can be developed iteratively based on demand
- Enhances competitive position
- Requires customer usage data to optimize

### Could Have (Phase 3 - Future)
Nice-to-have features that provide additional value but are not essential for product success. Build only if resources allow or strong customer demand emerges.

**Criteria:**
- Incremental improvements
- Low priority for initial users
- Can differentiate in mature market
- May require significant resources

### Won't Have (Explicitly Excluded)
Features explicitly excluded from the roadmap, either permanently or until business model changes.

**Criteria:**
- Out of scope for target market
- Too complex for solo developer
- Requires partnerships or ecosystem not yet built
- Better served by integrations

  - Content creation requires different skills
  - Videos quickly become outdated
  - Better to partner with training providers
- **Won't Have Because**: Out of core competency
- **Future Consideration**: Partner with safety training companies
- **Alternative**: Link to external training resources

**Feature**: Social/community features (forums, sharing)
- **Rationale**:
  - B2B SaaS users want privacy, not social
  - Community requires moderation
  - Template sharing sufficient for collaboration
- **Won't Have Because**: Not aligned with B2B use case
- **Future Consideration**: Template marketplace in Year 2+
- **Alternative**: LinkedIn groups for community

**Feature**: Blockchain-based audit trail
- **Rationale**:
  - Immutable Firestore logs sufficient for compliance
  - Blockchain adds complexity and cost
  - No customer demand for blockchain
- **Won't Have Because**: Solution looking for problem
- **Future Consideration**: Only if regulations require blockchain
- **Alternative**: Current immutable audit trail meets all requirements

**Feature**: IoT sensor integration
- **Rationale**:
  - Very few construction sites have IoT sensors
  - Would require hardware partnerships
  - Too niche for current market
- **Won't Have Because**: Market not ready
- **Future Consideration**: If IoT becomes standard in 3-5 years
- **Alternative**: Manual environmental logging sufficient

**Feature**: VR/AR training simulations
- **Rationale**:
  - Requires VR development expertise
  - Hardware requirements too high
  - Training is separate from risk analysis
- **Won't Have Because**: Out of scope, different product category
- **Future Consideration**: Never - partner with VR training companies instead
- **Alternative**: Focus on documentation, not training

## 5. Feature Prioritization Framework

### Decision Tree for New Feature Requests

```
New Feature Request
    │
    ├─ Does it solve problem for >50% of customers?
    │   ├─ YES → Continue evaluation
    │   └─ NO → Reject or Could Have
    │
    ├─ Is it technically feasible for solo developer?
    │   ├─ YES → Continue evaluation
    │   └─ NO → Won't Have (consider partnership)
    │
    ├─ Does it align with core TRA/LMRA value proposition?
    │   ├─ YES → Continue evaluation
    │   └─ NO → Could Have or Won't Have
    │
    ├─ What is effort estimate?
    │   ├─ <1 week → Could Have (low risk to try)
    │   ├─ 1-3 weeks → Should Have (if high value)
    │   └─ >3 weeks → Won't Have (too risky for solo dev)
    │
    └─ Is customer willing to pay more for it?
        ├─ YES → Should Have or Must Have
        └─ NO → Could Have or Won't Have
```

### Monthly Feature Review Process

1. **Collect Feedback**: Aggregate feature requests from customers
2. **Quantify Demand**: Count requests per feature
3. **Assess Effort**: Estimate development time
4. **Calculate Priority Score**: (Request Count × User Impact) / Effort
5. **Make Decision**: Use decision tree above
6. **Communicate**: Update roadmap, notify requesters

## 6. Success Metrics by Phase

### MVP (Phase 1) Success Criteria

**Launch Readiness:**
- [ ] All Must Have features complete and tested
- [ ] 3-5 design partners using product successfully
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in production
- [ ] <2 second page load times
- [ ] >99% uptime in testing period
- [ ] VCA compliance validated

**Business Metrics (Month 1-3 post-launch):**
- 10+ paying customers
- €5K+ MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- >80% trial-to-paid conversion (design partners)
- <10% churn rate
- NPS >40

**Product Metrics (Month 1-3 post-launch):**
- Average TRA creation time <30 minutes
- Average LMRA execution time <5 minutes
- >70% of TRAs use templates
- >90% LMRA completion rate
- <5% TRA abandonment rate

### Phase 2 Validation Criteria

**Before Building Phase 2 Features:**
- [ ] MVP achieving business metrics above
- [ ] Specific feature requests from >30% of customers
- [ ] Clear ROI demonstrated for feature
- [ ] Resources available without compromising core product quality

**Phase 2 Success Metrics:**
- Feature adoption >50% within 3 months
- Positive impact on core metrics (retention, NPS)
- No negative impact on performance or stability

## 7. Risk Mitigation

### Scope Creep Prevention

**Red Flags:**
- Feature complexity exceeding 1 week of work
- Feature requested by <3 customers
- Feature doesn't solve core TRA/LMRA problem
- Feature adds significant maintenance burden

**Prevention Strategies:**
1. **Weekly Scope Review**: Check current work against this document
2. **Customer Validation Gate**: No feature without customer validation
3. **Timeboxing**: If feature takes >150% of estimate, stop and reassess
4. **Feedback Loop**: Show customers MVP, let them prioritize Phase 2

### Feature Debt Management

**Tracking Deferred Features:**
- Maintain Feature Request Backlog in GitHub Issues
- Tag by MoSCoW category
- Review monthly for reprioritization
- Communicate roadmap to customers quarterly

**When to Revisit Won't Have:**
- Market conditions change significantly
- Competitor launches similar feature successfully
- Customer demand exceeds 50% of customer base
- Technical feasibility improves (new tools, APIs)
